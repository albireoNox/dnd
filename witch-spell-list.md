# Witch Class Spell List

## Description

From DMG p. 174 

> Below is a new spell list for a variant spellcasting class: the witch. A staple of fantasy literature and fairy tails, the witch dabbles in many kinds of magic -- minor illusions, spells dealing with health or life, nature-based magic, simple divinations, and spells that alter the shape and appearance of things -- but excels at just a few. Hence, her list is somewhat limited, but it contains wizard, cleric, and druid spells. She casts spells as a sorcerer, using the sorcerer's Spells per Day table (see page 52 of the *Players Handbook*), and her spells are based on Charisma. The witch's spell list is designed with the following considerations in mind. 
>
> **Cure Spells**: Only the weakest of these, and the witch doesn't have the cleric's ability to cast *cure* spells spontaneously. The witch isn't blessed with a cleric's (or druid's) plethora of healing spells, but she can offer a little aid to those she favors/ 
>
> **Illusions**: Only through the middle levels. A witch can trick her foes, but not the extent that a wizard can. 
>
> **Divinations**: Only the straigtforward divinations, such as *clairvoyance/clairaudience* and *scrying*, and not even all of them/
>
> **Charms:** Many. A major feature of this class.
>
> **Form-Changing:** Another strong point for the witch. From *alter self* to *shapechange*, the witch has most of the spells relating to changing her (or someone else's) form. 
>
> **Nature**: From speaking to animals to controlling the weather, the witch dabbles in this type of magic, if for no other reason than she usually lives a secluded life in the wilderness. 
>
> **No Flashy Spells:** Anything from a *lightning bolt* to a *wall of fire* to a *Bigby's hand* spell is right out. The witch's archetype doesn't suggest overt attack spells or spells that create massive magic constructs. She doesn't summon monsters, place wards, or teleport from place to place. Her magic is subtle. 
>
> **Miscellaneous:** Spells such as *whispering wind*, *Leomund's tiny hut,* *bestow curse* (and a few other curselike spells), and a few communication spells round out the list. 

## Spell List

All spells listed in normal text are included from the list published in the DMG p. 174. *Italicized* spells are included from elsewhere on the basis of fitting the architype of the Witch described above. Spells with ~~strikethrough~~ are spells that were included in the list from the DMG, but have been removed for not fitting the archetype of the Witch.
